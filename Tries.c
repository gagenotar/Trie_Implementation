// The following program utilizes a trie to organize a list of data.
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
// A trie (pronounced try) is a tree-based abstract data type.
// Each node in a trie tpyically has two main values.
// One is something to signify if the given node is the last letter of a word.
// In this case, that value belongs to endsWord, where it is true (1) if it completes a word.
// The other is a pointer to possible branches, which in this case represents possible letters.

// For example, if the word "the" is inserted into the trie, e.endsWord == 1 as it ends the word.
// If the word "themes" was then added to the trie, s.endsWord == 1 as well.
// Keep in mind, however, that e.endsWord will still remain 1.

// Now, when searching to see if "the" is a word, the trie will recognize that that "e" is the end
// of one word, but it also has branches, indicating it is a part of a bigger word as well.
// This logic is essential when writing a function that deletes certain words from a trie.

// So, if one wanted to delete "the" from the trie, all that would need to happen 
// is to set e.endsWord = 0, and it would no longer be seen as the end of a word.
